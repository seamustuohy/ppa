           A Threat Model for Pervasive Passive Surveillance
                   draft-trammell-perpass-ppa-01.txt

Abstract

   This document elaborates a threat model for pervasive surveillance.
   We assume an adversary with an interest in indiscriminate
   eavesdropping that can passively observe network traffic at every
   layer at every point in the network between the endpoints.  It is
   intended to demonstrate to protocol designers and implementors the
   observability and inferability of information and metainformation
   transported over their respective protocols, to assist in the
   evaluation of the performance of these protocols and the
   effectiveness of their protection mechanisms under pervasive passive
   surveillance.

1.  Introduction

   Surveillance is defined in [RFC6973], Section 5.1.1, as "the
   observation or monitoring of an individual's communications or
   activities".  Pervasive passive surveillance in the Internet is the
   practice of surveillance at widespread observation points, without
   any particular target in mind at surveillance time of surveillance,
   and without any modification or injection of of network traffic.



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 2]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   Pervasive passive surveillance allows subsequent analysis and
   inference to be applied to the collected data to achieve surveillance
   aims on a target to be identified later, or to analyze general
   communications patterns and/or behaviors without a specified target
   individual or group.

   This differentiates privacy in the face of pervasive surveillance
   from privacy as addressed in the literature, in that threats to
   privacy are generally (as in [RFC6973]) taken to have as a specific
   goal revealing the identity and/or associations of a specified
   individual; defeating pervasive surveillance of a large population is
   therefore more difficult than protecting the privacy of a single
   individual within a larger population.

   In this document, we take as given that communications systems should
   aim to provide privacy guarantees to their users, and that
   susceptibility to pervasive surveillance should avoided to the extent
   possible as a design goal in protocol design.  From these assumptions
   we take the very act of pervasive surveillance to be adversarial by
   definition.

   This document outlines a threat model for an entity performing
   pervasive passive surveillance, termed the Pervasive Passive
   Adversary (PPA), and explores how to apply this model to the
   evaluation of protocols.  As the primary threat posed by pervasive
   surveillance is a threat to the privacy of the parties to a given
   communication, this document is heavily based on [RFC6973].

2.  Terminology

   [EDITOR'S NOTE: Check to see whether we actually use these...]

   The terms Anonymity, Anonymity Set, Anonymous, Attacker,
   Eavesdropper, Fingerprint, Fingerprinting, Identifier, Identity,
   Individual, Initiator, Intermediary, Observer, Pseudonym,
   Pseudonymity, Pseudonymous, Recipient, and Traffic Analysis are used
   in this document as defined by Section 3, Terminology, of [RFC6973].
   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Observation:   Information collected directly from communications by
      an eavesdropper or observer.  For example, the knowledge that
      <alice@example.com> sent a message to <bob@example.com> via SMTP
      taken from the headers of an observed SMTP message would be an
      observation.

   Inference:   Information extracted from analysis of information
      collected directly from communications by an eavesdropper or
      observer.  For example, the knowledge that a given web page was



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 3]

      accessed by a given IP address, by comparing the size in octets of
      measured network flow records to fingerprints derived from known
      sizes of linked resources on the web servers involved would be an
      inference.

3.  The Pervasive Passive Adversary

   The pervasive passive adversary (PPA) is an indiscriminate
   eavesdropper on a computer network that can:

   o  observe every packet of all communications at any or every hop in
      any network path between an initiator and a recipient; and can

   o  observe data at rest in intermediate systems between the endpoints
      controlled by the initiator and recipient; but

   o  takes no other action with respect to these communications (i.e.,
      blocking, modification, injection, etc.).

   We note that a threat model that limits the adversary to being
   completely passive may under-represent the threat to communications
   privacy posed especially by well-resourced adversaries, but submit
   that it represents the maximum capability of a single entity
   interested in remaining undetectable.

   The techniques available to the PPA are direct observation and
   inference.  Direct observation involves taking information directly
   from eavesdropped communications - e.g., URLs identifying content or
   email addresses identifying individuals from application-layer
   headers.  Inference, on the other involves analyzing eavesdropped
   information to derive new information from it; e.g., searching for
   application or behavioral fingerprints in observed traffic to derive
   information about the observed individual from them, in absence of
   directly-observed sources of the same information.

   We would like to assume that the PPA does not have the ability to
   observe communications on trusted systems at either the initiator or
   a recipient of a communication, as there would seem to be little that
   a protocol designer could do in the case of compromised endpoints.
   However, given the state of vulnerability of many endpoints to
   various security exploits, we would encourage protocol designers to
   consider the protections their protocols afford to the privacy of
   their users even in the face of partially compromised endpoints.

   The PPA may additionally have have privileged information allowing
   the reversal of strong encryption -- e.g. compromised key material or
   knowledge of weaknesses in the design or implementation of
   cryptographic algorithms at the initiator, recipient, and/or



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   intermediaries.  However, we consider the evaluation and improvement
   of cryptographic protections, while important to improving the
   security of the Internet in the face of pervasive surveillance, to be
   out of scope for this work: here, we will assume that a given
   cryptographic protection for a protocol works as advertised.

4.  Threat analysis

   On initial examination, the PPA would appear to be trivially
   impossible to defend against.  If the PPA has access to every byte of
   every packet of a communication, then full application payload and
   content is available for applications which do not provide
   encryption.

   Guidance to protocol designers [RFC3365] to provide cryptographic
   protection of confidentiality in their protocols improves this
   situation a great deal.  The use of TLS [RFC5246] reduces the
   information available for correlation to the network and transport
   layer headers (e.g. source and destination IP addresses and ports) on
   each hop, but leaves any data at rest used by a protocol on
   intermediate systems vulnerable to intermediate system compromise.

   End-to-end approaches (e.g. S/MIME [RFC3851]) help defend against
   this threat.  However, protocols that route messages based on
   recipient identifier or pseudonym, such as SMTP [RFC2821] and XMPP
   [RFC6120], still require intermediate systems to handle these in the
   clear, and may leak additional metadata as well (e.g., in the S/MIME
   example, the SMTP headers), making this available to the PPA if it is
   has compromised these intermediate systems.

   We can assume that the PPA does not have unlimited resources, i.e.,
   that it will attempt to eavesdrop at the most efficient observation
   point(s) available to it, and will collect as little raw data as
   necessary to support its aims.  This allows us to back away from this
   worst-case scenario.  Storing full packet information for a fully-
   loaded 10 Gigabit Ethernet link will fill one 4TB hard disk (the
   largest commodity hard disk available as of this writing) in less
   than an hour; storing network flow data from the same link, e.g. as
   IPFIX Files [RFC5655], requires on the order of 1/1000 the storage
   (i.e., 4GB an hour).  Metadata-based surveillance approaches are
   therefore more scalable for pervasive surveillance, so it is
   worthwhile to analyze information which can be inferred from various
   network traffic capture and analysis techniques other than full
   packet observation.

   In the remainder of this analysis, we categorize the ways that
   information radiates off of protocols on the Internet.  First, we
   list kinds of information that can be directly observed; this may



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 5]

   seem somewhat obvious, but is included for completeness.  We then
   explore the types of information which may be useful for drawing
   inferences about user behavior, then go into practical detail on
   inference attacks against just information available in the IP
   header, to better illustrate the extent of the problem.

4.1.  Information subject to direct observation

   Protocols which do not encrypt their payload make the entire content
   of the communication available to a PPA along their path.  Following
   the advice in [RFC3365], most such protocols have a secure variant
   which encrypts payload for confidentiality, and these secure variants
   are seeing ever-wider deployment.  A noteworthy exception is DNS
   [RFC1035], as DNSSEC [RFC4033] does not have confidentiality as a
   requirement.  This implies that all DNS queries and answers generated
   by the activities of any protocol are available to a PPA.

   Protocols which encrypt their payload using an application- or
   transport-layer encryption scheme (e.g. TLS [RFC5246]) still expose
   all the information in their network and transport layer headers to a
   PPA, including source and destination addresses and ports.  IPsec ESP
   [RFC4303] further encrypts the transport-layer headers, but still
   leaves IP address information unencrypted; in tunnel mode, these
   addresses correspond to the tunnel endpoints.  Cryptographic
   protocols themselves, e.g. the TLS session identifier, may leak
   information that can be used for correlation and inference.  While
   this information is much less semantically rich than the application
   payload, it can still be useful for the inferring an individual's
   activities.

   Protocols which imply the storage of some data at rest in
   intermediaries leave this data subject to observation at a PPA that
   has compromised these intermediaries, unless the data is encrypted
   end-to-end by the application layer protocol, or the implementation
   uses an encrypted store for this data.

4.2.  Information useful for inference

   Inference is information extracted from later analysis of an observed
   communication, and/or correlation of observed information with
   information available from other sources.  Indeed, most useful
   inference performed by a PPA falls under the rubric of correlation.
   The simplest example of this is the observation of DNS queries and
   answers from and to a source and correlating those with IP addresses
   with which that source communicates can give access to information
   otherwise not available from encrypted application payloads (e.g.,
   the Host: HTTP/1.1 request header when HTTP is used with TLS).




Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   Inference can also leverage information obtained from sources other
   than direct traffic observation.  Geolocation databases, for example,
   have been developed map IP addresses to a location, in order to
   provide location-aware services such as targeted advertising.  This
   location information is often of sufficient resolution that it can be
   used to draw further inferences toward identifying or profiling an
   individual.

   Social media provide another source of more or less publicly
   accessible information.  This information can be extremely
   semantically rich, including information about an individual's
   location, associations with other individuals and groups, and
   activities.  Further, this information is generally contributed and
   curated by the individuals themselves: it represents information
   which the individuals are not necessarily interested in protecting
   for privascy reasons.  However, correlation of this social networking
   data with information available from direct observation of network
   traffic allows the creation of a much richer picture of an
   individual's activities than either alone.  We note with some alarm
   that there is little that can be done from the protocol design side
   to limit such correlation by a PPA, and that the existence of such
   data sources in many cases greatly complicates the problem of
   protecting privacy by hardening protocols alone.

4.3.  On the Non-Anonymity of IP Addresses

   In this section, we explore the non-anonymity of even encrypted IP
   traffic by examining some inference techniques for associating a set
   of addresses with an individual, in order to illustrate the
   difficulty of defending communications against a PPA.  Here, the
   basic problem is that information radiated even from protocols which
   have no obvious connection with personal data can be correlated with
   other information which can paint a very rich behavioral picture,
   that only takes one unprotected link in the chain to associate with
   an identity.

4.3.1.  Analysis of IP headers

   Internet traffic can be monitored by tapping Internet links, or by
   installing monitoring tools in Internet routers.  Of course, a single
   link or a single router only provides access to a fraction of the
   global Internet traffic.  However, monitoring a number of high
   capacity links or a set of routers placed at strategic locations
   provides access to a good sampling of Internet traffic.

   Tools like IPFIX [RFC7011] allow administrators to acquire statistics
   about sequences of packets with some common properties that pass
   through a network device.  The most common set of properties used in



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   flow measurement is the "five-tuple" of source and destination
   addresses, protocol type, and source and destination ports.  These
   statistics are commonly used for network engineering, but could
   certainly be used for other purposes.

   Let's assume for a moment that IP addresses can be correlated to
   specific services or specific users.  Analysis of the sequences of
   packets will quickly reveal which users use what services, and also
   which users engage in peer-to-peer connections with other users.
   Analysis of traffic variations over time can be used to detect
   increased activity by particular users, or in the case of peer-to-
   peer connections increased activity within groups of users.

4.3.2.  Correlation of IP addresses to user identities

   In Section 4.3.1, we have assumed that IP addresses can be correlated
   with specific user identities.  This can be done in various ways.

   Tools like reverse DNS lookup can be used to retrieve the DNS names
   of servers.  Since the addresses of servers tend to be quite stable
   and since servers are relatively less numerous than users, a PPA
   could easily maintain its own copy of the DNS for well-known or
   popular servers, to accelerate such lookups.

   On the other hand, the reverse lookup of IP addresses of users is
   generally less informative less informative.  For example, a lookup
   of the address currently used by one author's home network returns a
   name of the form "c-192-000-002-033.hsd1.wa.comcast.net".  This
   particular type of reverse DNS lookup generally reveals only coarse-
   grained location information.

   In many jurisdictions, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are required
   to provide identification on a case by case basis of the "owner" of a
   specific IP address for law enforcement purposes.  This is a
   reasonably expedient process for targeted investigations, but
   pervasive surveillance requires something more efficient.  A PPA that
   could secure the cooperation of the ISP could correlate IP addresses
   and user identities automatically.

   Even if the ISP does not cooperate, identity can often be obtained
   via inference.  We will discuss in the next section how SMTP and HTTP
   can leak information that links the IP address to the identity of the
   user.

4.3.3.  Monitoring messaging clients for IP address correlation

   POP3 [RFC1939] and IMAP [RFC3501] are used to retrieve mail from mail
   servers, while a variant of SMTP [RFC5321] is used to submit messages



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   through mail servers.  IMAP connections originate from the client,
   and typically start with an authentication exchange in which the
   client proves its identity by answering a password challenge.

   If the protocol is executed in clear text, monitoring services can
   "tap" the links to the mail server, retrieve the user name provided
   by the client, and associate it with the IP address used to establish
   the connection.

   The same attack can be executed against the SIP [RFC3261] protocol,
   if the connection between the SIP UA and the SIP server operates in
   clear text

   In addition, there are many instant messaging services operating over
   the Internet using proprietary protocols.  If any of these
   proprietary protocols includes clear-text transmission of the user
   identity, these can be observed to provide an association between the
   user identity and the IP address.

4.3.4.  Retrieving IP addresses from mail headers

   SMTP [RFC5321] requires that each successive SMTP relay adds a
   "Received" header to the mail headers.  The purpose of these headers
   is to enable audit of mail transmission, and perhaps to distinguish
   between regular mail and spam.  Here is an extract from the headers
   of a message recently received from the "perpass" mailing list:

    Received: from 192-000-002-044.zone13.example.org (HELO ?192.168.1.100?)
   (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
   by lvps192-000-002-219.example.net with ESMTPSA
   (DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA encrypted, authenticated);
   27 Oct 2013 21:47:14 +0100
    Message-ID: <526D7BD2.7070908@example.org>
    Date: Sun, 27 Oct 2013 20:47:14 +0000
    From: Some One <some.one@example.org>


   This is the first "Received" header attached to the message by the
   first SMTP relay.  For privacy reasons, the field values have been
   anonymized.  We learn here that the message was submitted by "Some
   One" on October 27, from a host behind a NAT (192.168.1.100)
   [RFC1918] that used the IP address 192.0.2.44.  The information
   remained in the message, and is accessible by all recipients of the
   "perpass" mailing list, or indeed by any PPA that sees at least one
   copy of the message.

   A PPA that can observe sufficient email traffic can regularly update
   the mapping between public IP addresses and individual email



Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   identities.  Even if the SMTP traffic was encrypted on submission and
   relaying, the PPA can still receive a copy of public mailing lists
   like "perpass".

   Similar information is available in the SIP headers [RFC3261].

4.3.5.  Tracking address use with web cookies

   Many web sites only encrypt a small fraction of their transactions.
   A popular pattern was to use HTTPS for the login information, and
   then use a "cookie" to associate following clear-text transactions
   with the user's identity.  Cookies are also used by various
   advertisement services to quickly identify the users and serve them
   with "personalized" advertisements.  Such cookies are particularly
   useful if the advertisement services want to keep tracking the user
   across multiple sessions that may use different IP addresses.

   As cookies are sent in clear text, a PPA can build a database that
   associates cookies to IP addresses for non-HTTPS traffic.  If the IP
   address is already identified, the cookie can be linked to the user
   identify.  After that, if the same cookie appears on a new IP
   address, the new IP address can be immediately associated with the
   pre-determined identity.

4.3.6.  Tracking address use with network graphs

   A PPA can track traffic from an IP address not yet associated with an
   individual to various public services (e.g. websites, mail servers,
   game servers), and exploit patterns in the observed traffic to
   correlate this address with other addresses that show similar
   patterns.  For example, any two addresses that show connections to
   the same IMAP or webmail services, the same set of favorite websites,
   and game servers at similar times of day may be associated with the
   same individual.  Correlated addresses can then be tied to an
   individual through one of the techniques above, walking the "network
   graph" to expand the set of attributable traffic.

5.  Evaluating protocols for PPA resistance

   Though inference by a PPA makes the problem of guaranteeing privacy
   in the face of passive surveillance difficult, it is possible to
   strengthen each link in the chain in order to increase their
   resistance.  PPA resistent protocols have the following properties:

   o  The confidentiality of all information not absolutely required for
      the operation of the protocol at intermediate systems is
      cryptographically protected.




Trammell, et al.          Expires May 17, 2014                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft         Pervasive Passive Adversary         November 2013


   o  The confidentiality of all identifiers which can be associated
      with specific individuals through observation or inference are
      cryptographically protected on a hop-by-hop basis, even if they
      are required for the operation of the protocol at intermediate
      systems.

   o  Identifiers required for the operation of the protocol are non-
      persistent and non-specific to individuals to the extent possible.

   o  The protocol radiates as little information as possible which can
      be used to fingerprint specific instances of the protocol.

   Clearly, the messaging protocols examined in Section 4.3 are, by
   these criteria, not particularly resistent to a PPA.  In evaluating a
   protocol for PPA resistance, tradeoffs in efficiency, latency,
   manageability, and other application requirements will need to be
   evaluated, as well.  More detailed information on privacy
   considerations for protocol design are given in
   [I-D.cooper-ietf-privacy-requirements].

6.  General protocol design recommendations for PPA resistance

   The following general recommendations are intended to guide
   discussions about improving the resistance of IETF protocols to a
   PPA; specific recommendations are the subject of a separate
   specification.

6.1.  Encrypt everything you can

   Though IETF protocols have been long moving in the direction of more
   and better cryptographic protection [RFC3365], there is continued
   room for improvement.  Approaches such as opportunistic encryption,
   while not providing identity guarantees, may have benefits in
   confidentiality that reduce the information radiated from protocols,
   increasing the costs for pervasive surveillance.  To some extent
   encryption is a deployment problem rather than a protocol design and
   implementation problem; improvements in usability may be useful here.

   The design and deployment of end-to-end encryption for a protocol,
   especially for messaging applications, can reduce the ability of a
   PPA to observe application-layer information and identifiers at a
   compromised intermediate system.

6.2.  Design and implement for simplicity and auditability

   This would seem to be common sense, but in practice it is not really
   the case that protocol design processes naturally have simplicity as
   a goal.  Simplicity of a design is directly related to the
   auditability of the design and implementations thereof.  Privacy and
   security features designed into a protocol which are too complex to
   understand will suffer from limited implementation and deployment.  A
   good example of such a case is IPsec where primary complaints are
   related to its complexity [Ferguson03].

   The auditability of a protocol is directly related to the ability to
   measure and reason about the information that it radiates that could
   be used for inference by a PPA.  Audits of designs and
   implementations can also reduce the risk of hidden side channels
   which could carry additional information useful to a PPA.  One
   approach for improving auditability is the release of implementations
   as open source.

6.3.  Allow for fingerprinting resistance in protocol designs

   Fingerprinting provides a source of information for inference, and
   can rely on packet and flow size and timing information.  The
   inclusion of null information in packets, or grouping information
   into more/fewer packets can reduce this risk.  Since protocols tend
   to be optimized for minimum bandwidth usage and minumum latency, the
   only way to go is up, so this resistance comes at the expense of
   usable bandwidth and increased latency.  While not necessarily
   applicable in the general case, protocol designs can make it possible
   do to this.

6.4.  Do not rely on static IP addresses

   Always on broadband connections may or may not provide the
   subscribers with static IP addresses.  Some users pay extra for the
   convenience of a stable address.  Of course, stable addresses greatly
   facilitate IP header monitoring.

   In contrast, we could imagine that the broadband modem is re-
   provisioned at regular interval with a new IPv4 address, or with a
   new IPv6 address prefix.  Some convenience will be lost, and TCP
   connections active before the renumbering will have to be
   reestablished.  However, the renumbering will significantly
   complicate the task of IP header monitoring.

   Similarly, the Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address
   Autoconfiguration in IPv6 [RFC4941] allow users to configure
   temporary IPv6 addresses out of a global prefix.  Privacy addresses

   are meant to be used for a short time, typically no more than a day,
   and are specifically designed to render monitoring based on IPv6
   addresses harder.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document explores the capabilities of an adversary with an
   interest in undermining the security of the Internet to enable
   pervasive surveillance activities.  It does not provide any specific
   protocol guidance that may impact the security of those protocols,
   but it is hoped that the awareness of this threat will end up being a
   metacontribution to Internet security.
